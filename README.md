 Task 1: Number Guessing Game.

## Description:
A simple C++ program where the computer generates a random number and the player has to guess it. The program provides feedback if the guess is "Too High" or "Too Low" and tracks the number of attempts.

## Features:
- **Dynamic Randomization:** Uses `time(0)` as a seed for `srand`.
- **User Input Validation:** Ensures the game continues until the correct guess is made.
- **Interactive Feedback:** Real-time hints to guide the player.

Task 2: Simple Calculator.

## Description:
A basic C++ calculator that does everyday math. The user enters two numbers and picks an operator (+, -, *, /). The program then calculates the answer and makes sure no math errors crash the system.

## Features:
- **Basic Math:** Easily adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides numbers based on the user's choice.
- **Smart Error Checking:** Stops the program from crashing if someone accidentally tries to divide a number by zero.
- **Keep Calculating:** Uses a loop so the user can do as many calculations as they want without having to restart the app.
