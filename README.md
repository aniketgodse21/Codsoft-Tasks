# Codsoft Tasks
 **Task 1: Number Guessing Game.**

## Description:
A simple C++ program where the computer generates a random number and the player has to guess it. The program provides feedback if the guess is "Too High" or "Too Low" and tracks the number of attempts.

## Features:
- **Dynamic Randomization:** Uses `time(0)` as a seed for `srand`.
- **User Input Validation:** Ensures the game continues until the correct guess is made.
- **Interactive Feedback:** Real-time hints to guide the player.



**Task 2: Simple Calculator.**

## Description:
A basic C++ calculator that does everyday math. The user enters two numbers and picks an operator (+, -, *, /). The program then calculates the answer and makes sure no math errors crash the system.

## Features:
- **Basic Math:** Easily adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides numbers based on the user's choice.
- **Smart Error Checking:** Stops the program from crashing if someone accidentally tries to divide a number by zero.
- **Keep Calculating:** Uses a loop so the user can do as many calculations as they want without having to restart the app.



**Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game.**

## Description:

A simple console-based C++ game where two players take turns playing Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid. Players enter a number from 1 to 9 to place their 'X' or 'O' marker. The program continuously checks for winning combinations or a full board after every move and announces the final result.

## Features:

**Interactive 2-Player Gameplay:** Allows players to enter their custom names and compete against each other locally.

**Real-Time Board Updates:** Displays and updates the 3x3 visual grid after every valid move so players can easily track the game state.

**Input Validation:** Prevents players from overwriting an already taken spot or entering invalid numbers outside the 1-9 range.

**Automatic Win/Draw Detection:** Evaluates the board after each turn across all rows, columns, and diagonals to accurately declare a winner or a tie.

## How to Play:

**Start the Game:** Run the program and enter the names for Player 1 (who will play as 'X') and Player 2 (who will play as 'O').

**Understand the Board:** The game board is a 3x3 grid. Each square on the grid corresponds to a number from 1 to 9.

**Take Your Turn:** When prompted, type the number (1-9) of the empty square where you want to place your marker and press Enter.

**Win the Game:** The first player to get three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins!

**Draw:** If all 9 squares are filled up and no one has matched three in a row, the game automatically ends in a tie.





**Task 4: To-Do List.**


## Description:

A friendly and interactive C++ console application that acts as a personal task assistant. It allows users to easily keep track of their daily tasks by adding, viewing, completing, and removing items from a dynamic list.
Features:

**Dynamic Task Management:** Uses C++ vectors to smoothly add and store multiple tasks during the session.

**Interactive Status Tracking:** Clearly displays tasks as [TASK PENDING] or [TASK COMPLETED] so users know exactly what is left to do.

**Smart Deletion & Confirmation:** Allows users to remove unwanted tasks while providing a safety (y/n) prompt to prevent accidental deletions.

**Session Summary:** Calculates and displays a final breakdown of completed versus pending tasks before the user exits the program.

## How to Use:

**Start the App:** Run the program to be greeted by your personal task assistant and view the main menu.

**Add Tasks:** Type '1' to enter a new task description and add it to your active list.

**View & Complete:** Type '2' to check your list, and type '3' to select a specific task number to mark as done.

**Clean Up:** Type '4' to delete a task you no longer need, keeping your list organized.

**Exit the App:** Type '5' to close the assistant and see your final productivity summary for the day!
